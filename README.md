# Linkiir Business Adapters

Enterprise business system adapters: CRM, ERP, ITSM, HR, identity and directory services, and scheduling and workforce operations.

A **catalog** is a package of adapter content that one Linkiir Grid publishes and other grids subscribe to. Subscribing adds these adapters to your grid without a product upgrade.

| **Catalog id** | `lkbz` |
| **Publisher** | Linkiir Inc |

## Subscribe

In Grid, open **Settings → Catalogs → Subscribe** and paste this URL:

```
https://github.com/Linkiir/linkiir-business-adapters
```

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **URL** | the address above |
| **Ref** | `main` |
| **SSH private key** | leave blank — this is a public repository, cloned anonymously |
| **Install name** | `linkiir-business-adapters` |

Use the install name exactly as given. Grid records it on every node built from this catalog, so a consistent name keeps a node's origin readable when you contact support.

Subscribing requires the **Manage catalogs** permission (Administration tier). Full instructions, including how to review an update before applying it, are in [the Catalogs documentation](https://help.linkiir.com/docs/catalogs/).

## Adapters

| Adapter | Type | Trigger | Version | Node type id |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Dynamics CRM Adapter** | source | interval | 1.0.0 | `LKBZ_DYNAMICS_CRM_ADAPTER` |
| **Salesforce Adapter** | transform | on message | 1.0.0 | `LKBZ_SALESFORCE_ADAPTER` |

### Dynamics CRM Adapter

Polls a Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM instance with a FetchXML query on each interval and pushes each matching record downstream as JSON.

`LKBZ_DYNAMICS_CRM_ADAPTER` · source node · version 1.0.0 · 7 configuration fields · library `dynamics_crm` 1.0.0

Credentials required: **Password**. These ship empty — see [Credentials](#credentials).

### Salesforce Adapter

Queries and updates Salesforce records via the REST API. Receives inbound data specifying what to query or modify, executes the operation, and pushes results downstream.

`LKBZ_SALESFORCE_ADAPTER` · transform node · version 1.0.0 · 7 configuration fields · library `salesforce` 1.0.0

Credentials required: **Client Secret**, **Key**. These ship empty — see [Credentials](#credentials).

## Libraries

Shared Lua modules the adapters above depend on. A node pins the exact version it uses, and published versions are immutable, so several can sit side by side.

| Library | Version | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `dynamics_crm` | 1.0.0 | Dynamics CRM Adapter |
| `salesforce` | 1.0.0 | Salesforce Adapter |

### `dynamics_crm` 1.0.0

Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM client. Handles OAuth 2.0 authentication against Azure AD and provides FetchXML query and generic request helpers. Copy the dynamics_crm/ folder into a node and add it to package.path.

Modules: `dynamics_crm.lua`, `dynamics_crm_auth.lua`, `dynamics_crm_http.lua`, `dynamics_crm_token.lua`

### `salesforce` 1.0.0

Salesforce REST API client. Handles OAuth 2.0 client_credentials authentication and provides query, modify, modifyBatch, delete and custom request helpers. Copy the salesforce/ folder into a node and add it to package.path.

Modules: `salesforce.lua`, `salesforce_auth.lua`, `salesforce_http.lua`, `salesforce_token.lua`

## Credentials

Every adapter here ships with its credential fields **empty**, by design. Password fields are encrypted with your own grid's key, so a value shipped from this repository could not be decrypted on your machine. Enter yours on the node after you build it.

Two fields appear on most adapters:

| Field | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Live Mode** | When off, requests are prepared and logged but never sent. Use it to confirm configuration and authentication before touching a live system. |
| **Verify TLS** | Verifies the server's certificate. Leave on. Turn it off only against a local service with a self-signed certificate. |

## Versions and updates

| | |
|---|---|
| **Adapters** | Versioned by the `version` field on each adapter. A change that does not move the version forward is rejected, so one version always means one specific set of files. |
| **Libraries** | Immutable. A published version is never edited; a fix ships as a new version. Nodes pinned to an older version are undisturbed by an update. |

Grid shows you the incoming commit and diff before applying an update. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what changed in each release.

## Repository layout

```
catalog.json                              catalog manifest
nodes/<slug>/node_config.json             an adapter definition
nodes/<slug>/*.lua                        its scripts
nodes/<slug>/samples/                     de-identified test messages
libraries/<name>/<version>/library.json   a published library version
libraries/<name>/<version>/<name>/*.lua   its modules
```

The layout matches Grid's own on-disk layout, so a pull applies no transform.

## Documentation and support

Product documentation lives at **[help.linkiir.com](https://help.linkiir.com/docs/catalogs/)** — how catalogs work, subscribing and reviewing updates, building nodes from catalog adapters, and offline delivery. This repository holds the adapter content itself; it is not the documentation site.

For a question about a specific adapter, quote its node type id.
